            <h2>Welcome to Plan to Part</h2>
            <h3>
              <span>Future -</span>
              <span>Saving -</span>
              <span>Generation</span>
            </h3>
            <p>I live at the Jersey Shore with my husband of 35 years Walter Gabela. My 2 daughters,
              Jacqueline and Marissa, spend as much time as they can at our beach home.
              With a BS in Economics from Rutgers University I started my career at Morgan Stanley 1979 where I worked on
              the equity trading desk. My career as an equity sales trader spanned 30 years working at high profile firms
              such as UBS and Goldman Sachs.   <br>
              In 2008 during bad economic times I left Wall St and moved to the beach full time.
              In 2008 my mom died from a tragic accident and my 7 siblings and I had a very difficult time settling the estate.
              It was not a high net worth estate but it did have financial assets, real estate and personal possession. The family
              was so distraught from the tragedy that it was extremely difficult to focus on possessions and selling real assets.
              My sister, Maria Morse, and a co-founder of Plan to Part, was executrix of the estate and painstakingly worked to balance
              all the emotions of our siblings and their children. It was at this time that Maria and I knew we did not want this chaos
              for our families when the time comes.  <br>
              We also realized we did not want traditional funeral parlor arrangements and repasse.
              It was clear we wanted more of a celebration of life to honor the past and to include as many family and friends in the
              celebration. As we began our search for a place to arrange our wishes  and to store all the information that will be needed
              for the family, we quickly realized very few online options existed. We also wanted to take it a step further including
              healthcare, legal, pet care and other important items in the plan. There is also online advice to plan estates and
              minimize taxation or utilize benefits. As we set off to start this online company we added Lisa Albanese as our third
              co-founder and the Plan to Part was created.

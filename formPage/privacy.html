                may allow you to decide which cookie to accept from any website on a case-by-case basis), we strongly

                Services. All of our Agents are contractually bound to protect the confidentiality of your Personal
                Information. We may also share non-personal Aggregate Information with our Agents so that they
                understand how and how often people use our Services and their services, which in turn allows both us
                and them to improve. We do not share your Secure Information with Agents.</p>

                to interfere with or harm the Services, we will investigate and cooperate with appropriate law
                enforcement officials, which may include sharing your Basic Information with them in order to protect

                Information from any governmental entity or other third party pursuant to a subpoena or analogous legal
                process before sharing any such requested information, unless we are legally prohibited from so
                notifying you or we have a good faith reason to believe that such sharing is or may be necessary to
                protect someone’s life, avoid serious physical injury or property loss or damage, or to prevent or
                investigate any ongoing crime.</p>

                particular when you fill out information on Plan to Part (PtP), you agree to the terms of this Privacy
                Policy and the collection, storage, use, processing and disclosure by (PtP), and its service providers.
                If you don’t agree
                with this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Service, please do not by virtue of you using the Services.
                Accordingly, while communications between you and us are protected in accordance with this Privacy
                Policy, they are not protected by the physician-patient privilege, doctor-patient confidentiality,
                attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, or any other fiduciary duty.</p>
            <br>

                Personal Information is of utmost and critical importance to us, which is why we have implemented a

                the security, privacy, confidentiality and integrity of your Personal Information, including without
                limitation your Secure Information.</p>
            <br>
            <p>For starters, your password is encrypted and not stored in a readable
                fashion. Moreover, our technology uses encryption algorithms of the same quality relied on by banks, the
                military and the U.S. government. When we collect, maintain, access, use, or disclose your Personal
                Information, including without limitation your Secured Information, we will do so using systems and
                processes consistent with information privacy and security requirements under applicable federal and
                state laws, including, without limitation, HIPAA. Accordingly, your Secure Information is stored in a
                HIPAA-compliant hosting provider that has 24/7 physical and biometric protections, firewalls, intrusion
                detection systems, and an array of other technological safeguards and security
                certifications.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Nevertheless, no website operator can guarantee that its security measures or safeguards
                will be 100% effective, and(PtP),cannot guarantee absolute security of any of your Personal Information,
                including without limitation your Secure Information. PLAN TO PART SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE

                LIMITATION SECURE INFORMATION.</p>
            <br>
            <p>If we discover a security incident that compromises your Secure
                Information, we will let you know about it in accordance with applicable law. Please notify us
                immediately of any suspected or unauthorized use of your password or account or any other such incident
                by contacting us through our help center.
